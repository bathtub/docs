    <h1>Community</h1>
    <p>
      Xmidt and it's ecosystem is developed in the open. Here are some of the 
			channels we use to communicate and contribute:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Issue tracker:</strong> Use the GitHub issue tracker
      for the various <a href="http://github.com/xmidt-org">Xmidt
      repositories</a> to file bugs and features request.
      If you need support, please send your questions to the
      <a href="">TBD</a>
      mailing list rather than filing a GitHub issue.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Please do not ask individual project members for
      support. Use the channels above instead, where the whole
      community can help you and benefit from the solutions
      provided.</em>
