Hello, world!

We've been working at getting the new site up and today we're far enough along
to push it out.

If you've been using **Webpa**, you'll notice that it's a smaller service built
on **Xmidt**.  This change came about to help develop the full potential of what
a simple, scalable cloud router could do... simplify services downstream.

You will also notice the **Codex** project has emerged as well.  This exciting
project will help us look into the past about a particular connected device so
we can better understand how to either handle or debug what is going on with it.

We will be working on the website as well as defining the product roadmap on
github.com.  We also want input, feedback and hopefully a bit of help from you
too.  Together we can solve some fun and tough challenges together.
